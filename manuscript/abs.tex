        We reviewed the capabilities of \gls{NFC} simulation tools
        for demand-driven and transition scenarios
        We also reviewed flexible, general, and performant algorithms 
        which succeed in similar applications within economics and industrial 
        engineering. 
        We found that current \gls{NFC} simulators struggle to deploy fuel 
        cycle facilities based on demand.  However, some algorithms exist which 
        could be applied to challenging nuclear fuel cycle simulation use 
        cases.
