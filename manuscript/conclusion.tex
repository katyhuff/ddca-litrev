        The review concludes that fuel cycle simulation tools approach scenario objective functions in 
        various ways.  Some wrap realizations of the simulator in an external 
        optimizer, while others employ look-ahead methods to predict malformed 
        simulation inputs.  These methods fail to realistically model the 
        process by which utilities, governments, and other stakeholders 
        actually make facility deployment decisions. Dynamic, demand-driven 
        facility deployment may be enabled by non-optimizing algorithms such as 
        \gls{ARMA} \cite{arma} and \gls{ARCH} \cite{arch}, deterministically 
        optimizing algorithms such as those implemented in \gls{GCAM} 
        \cite{gcam} and \gls{MARKAL} \cite{markal}, or stochastic optimization 
        techniques such as Markov Switching Models \cite{markovswitching}.
