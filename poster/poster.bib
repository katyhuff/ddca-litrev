	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {A nuclear fuel cycle systems modeling and code-to-code comparison effort was coordinated across multiple national laboratories to verify the tools needed to perform fuel cycle analyses of the transition from a once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a sustainable potential future fuel cycle. For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved (DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current US fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

	abstract = {Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is endemic in the southeast of Iran. This study aimed to predict the incidence of CCHF and its related factors and explore the possibility of developing an empirical forecast system using time-series analysis of 13 years' data. Data from 2000 to 2012 were obtained from the Health Centre of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Climate Organization and the Veterinary Organization in the southeast of Iran. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and Markov switching models (MSM) were performed to examine the potential related factors of CCHF outbreaks. These models showed that the mean temperature (°C), accumulated rainfall (mm), maximum relative humidity (\%) and legal livestock importation from Pakistan (LIP) were significantly correlated with monthly incidence of CCHF in different lags (P {\textless} 0·05). The modelling fitness was checked with data from 2013. Model assessments indicated that the MSM had better predictive ability than the SARIMA model [MSM: root mean square error (RMSE) 0·625, Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) 266·33; SARIMA: RMSE 0·725, AIC 278·8]. This study shows the potential of climate indicators and LIP as predictive factors in modelling the occurrence of CCHF. Our results suggest that MSM provides more information on outbreak detection and can be a better predictive model compared to a SARIMA model for evaluation of the relationship between explanatory variables and the incidence of CCHF.},

	abstract = {Time series models are often constructed by combining nonstationary effects such as trends with stochastic processes that are believed to be stationary. Although stationarity of the underlying process is typically crucial to ensure desirable properties or even validity of statistical estimators, there are numerous time series models for which this stationarity is not yet proven. A major barrier is that the most commonly-used methods assume φ-irreducibility, a condition that can be violated for the important class of discrete-valued observation-driven models. We show (strict) stationarity for the class of Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average (GARMA) models, which provides a flexible analogue of ARMA models for count, binary, or other discrete-valued data. We do this from two perspectives. First, we show conditions under which GARMA models have a unique stationary distribution (so are strictly stationary when initialized in that distribution). This result potentially forms the foundation for broadly showing consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators for GARMA models. Since these conclusions are not immediate, however, we also take a second approach. We show stationarity and ergodicity of a perturbed version of the GARMA model, which utilizes the fact that the perturbed model is φ-irreducible and immediately implies consistent estimation of the mean, lagged covariances, and other functionals of the perturbed process. We relate the perturbed and original processes by showing that the perturbed model yields parameter estimates that are arbitrarily close to those of the original model.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development and validation methods of the FUTURE (FUel cycle analysis Tool for nUcleaR Energy) code, which was developed for a dynamic material flow evaluation and economic analysis of the nuclear fuel cycle. This code enables an evaluation of a nuclear material flow and its economy for diverse nuclear fuel cycles based on a predictable scenario. The most notable virtue of this FUTURE code, which was developed using C\# and MICROSOFT SQL DBMS, is that a program user can design a nuclear fuel cycle process easily using a standard process on the canvas screen through a drag-and-drop method. From the user’s point of view, this code is very easy to use thanks to its high flexibility. In addition, the new code also enables the maintenance of data integrity by constructing a database environment of the results of the nuclear fuel cycle analyses.},

By deterministic optimization all the algorithms that follow a rigorous mathematical approach are intended. Strictly speaking this refers to mathematical programming. After introducing the terminology used in this field, line-search and trust region strategies are described. The chapter is further subdivided into two major sections: unconstrained and constrained optimization. In the first several optimization methods are introduced such as simplex, Newton and quasi-Newton, conjugate directions, and Levenberg–Marquardt. In the latter, due to the complexity of the topic only a brief discussion on the main aspects and approaches found in constrained optimization algorithms is given. These are elimination methods, Lagrangian methods, active set methods, 0s methods. Sequential quadratic programming and mixed integer programming are also introduced. In the conclusions, the different algorithms are discussed in terms of their simplicity, reliability, and efficiency.},

This is a completely different approach to optimization, having different characteristics and also a different aims compared to the more classical methods discussed in the previous chapter. The concepts of multi-objective optimization and Pareto optimality are introduced in the beginning, and a comparison with the deterministic optimization algorithms is performed stressing out the pros and the cons of these different approaches to optimization. Several algorithms for stochastic optimization are presented such as particle swarm optimization, game theory optimization, evolutionary and genetic algorithms. Some guidelines on how to choose the most suitable stochastic optimization algorithm depending on the problem to be addressed are given in the end.},

This work is intended to cross check the new capabilities of the fuel cycle scenario code TR\_EVOL.This process has been divided in two stages. The first stage is dedicated to check the improvements in the nuclear fuel mass balance estimation using the available data for the Spanish nuclear fuel cycle. The second stage has been focusedin verifying the validity of the TR\_EVOL economic module, comparing results to data published by the ARCAS EU project. A specific analysis was required to evaluate the back-end cost. Data published by the waste management responsible institutions was used for the validation of the methodology. Results were highly satisfactory for both stages. In particular, the economic assessment provides a difference smaller than 3\% regarding results published by the
ARCAS project (NRG estimations). Furthermore, concerning the back-end cost, results are highly acceptable (7\% difference for a final disposal in a once-through scenario and around 11\% for a final disposal in a reprocessing strategy) given the significant uncertainties involved in design concepts and related unit costs.},

Especially in the light of the different roadmap exercises that have been undertaken in the past years indicating the need for symbiotic nuclear energy systems in the longer term. The symbiosis between different nuclear reactor types and their associated fuel cycle should fulfill competing objectives for such systems, i.e. economics, environmental friendliness, resource longevity, waste management, and non-proliferation. A new code, dubbed DANESS, has been developed which allows performing such dynamic analysis of nuclear energy systems composed of multiple reactors and fuel cycle options including cross-flow of fissile material between the different components of the system. Today, the code allows mass-flow analysis and economics and is currently being extended to include life-cycle analysis data, non-proliferation metrics and non-nuclear energy sources. This paper will describe the main features of this code and will indicate the possible uses and future developments.},

	abstract = {Volatility is a key parameter used in many financial applications, from derivatives
valuation to asset management and risk management. Volatility measures the size
of the errors made in modeling returns and other financial variables. It was discovered
that, for vast classes of models, the average size of volatility is not constant but
changes with time and is predictable. Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity
(ARCH)/generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models
and stochastic volatility models are the main tools used to model and forecast volatility.
Moving from single assets to portfolios made of multiple assets, we find that not
only idiosyncratic volatilities but also correlations and covariances between assets are
time varying and predictable. Multivariate ARCH/GARCH models and dynamic factor
models, eventually in a Bayesian framework, are the basic tools used to forecast
correlations and covariances.},

	abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

Although the results reject both the stable and the integrated models, our analysis of the response coefficients of the past shocks and the application of the models to the estimation of the capital requirements for trading the currencies show that there are no substantial differences between the fractionally integrated models and the stable models.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the generic problem of production planning in a divergent timber production environment. It aims at analysing the performance of various demand-driven production strategies of a timber production system. This analysis is performed using a simulation platform built on an agent-based advanced planning system. Nine production strategies configurations are evaluated under six scenarios in order to carry out a complete mixed level design of 54 simulation runs. Each of these configurations is a combination of a decoupling point position and a level of capacity that is committed to contracts with customers. Accordingly, the six scenarios are designed as a combination of supply type (i.e. log diameter distribution) and timber market prices. Production processes and co-production yields are based on a real manufacturing system from eastern Canada. Performance is evaluated from the logistic and economic points of view. Results demonstrate that demand-driven planning approaches that propagate demand information upstream the supply chain have the potential to improve planned customer service and reduce planned inventories. Results also show that timber companies need to receive a premium from their customers in order to compensate from the loss of potential value resulting from a more constrained planning environment.},

In this paper, a data-driven approach for the development of a daily steam load model is presented. Data-mining algorithms are used to select significant parameters used to develop models. A neural network (NN) ensemble with five MLPs (multi-layer perceptrons) performed best among all data-mining algorithms tested and therefore was selected to develop a predictive model. To meet the constraints of the existing energy management applications, Monte Carlo simulation is used to investigate uncertainty propagation of the model built by using weather forecast data. Based on the formulated model and weather forecasting data, future steam consumption is estimated. The latter allows optimal decisions to be made while managing fuel purchasing, scheduling the steam boiler, and building energy consumption.},

Demand Driven Dispatch (D³) is an operating concept that addresses this problem. Utilizing a demand forecast which improves as flight departure approaches, aircraft are dynamically assigned to flights to better match the predicted final demands. The result, demonstrated in studies of actual airline systems, is an increase in passenger loads and revenues with simultaneously reduced costs for a net of 1-5\% improvement in operating profits. Concept implementation is simplified by the prevalence of yield management systems which provide the forecasting capability, and the emergence of airplane families which provide the necessary operational flexibility. Implementation also requires frequent solution of extremely large aircraft assignment problems. These problems, which can be formulated in terms of a multicommodity network flow, can be solved with heuristic algorithms shown to exhibit an accuracy and efficiency essential to successful concept implementation.},
